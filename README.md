# Strategic Churn Prediction & Retention Framework

## 📌 Project Overview
Developed an end-to-end churn prediction pipeline for a SaaS platform to identify at-risk subscribers. This project transitions from raw data cleaning to a statistically-powered retention strategy.

## 📊 Key Results
* **Performance:** Achieved a **0.84 ROC-AUC**, indicating high discriminative power.
* **Segmentation:** Isolated a high-risk cohort (8.9% of users) with a significant risk lift over the baseline.
* **Top Drivers:** Identified Fiber Optic services and manual payment methods as the primary churn catalysts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Model:** Logistic Regression (Standardized & Balanced)

## 📈 Strategic Impact
Beyond prediction, this project includes a **Power Analysis for A/B Testing**, providing a blueprint for how the business can scientifically validate retention interventions (e.g., migration to auto-pay or targeted Fiber-user discounts).
